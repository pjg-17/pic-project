## The project is about referring a marketing company based in Brazil named 'Magist' to a company 'Eniac', based in Spain, Which is a marketing company for high Apple products.
   For the sales of their products there and testing the south america nation tech-products market.
## Using the DataBase from magist, an analysis was done to view if the recommendatiom for partnership will be profitable for the next three years as a test. using SQL and Tableau and Google search Engine
## While completing the project we were able toaceertain how the brazillian market is doing wiith high tech products like Apple product is faring.
   Diving into the databse we were able to use SQL to create a single table using JOINS(inner-joins, left-joins and right-joins)and how to convert tables from the SCHEMAS to csv.files and then transfer them to Tableau.
   There we learnt how to join them with Tableau,and also usins Tableau to plot charts (pie,bars etc) thereby learning how to visualise our findings.
## We ecountered some difficulties with the JOINS in SQL and some difficulties with the calculated Field and creating parameters and Segments in Tableau.
## It was a worthwhile project for me as a new-commer to this field, it exposed me to a real life-work challenges to solve,Interesting i will say.
